Videos and photos posted on social media show Saudi Arabia using Canadian equipment on Shia dissidents. Canada warned it would take action if ""it is found that Canadian exports have been used to commit serious violations of human rights"".","The Canadian government is investigating reports that Saudi Arabia is using armoured vehicles made in Canada against its own civilians ? allegations that have prompted renewed scrutiny over Ottawa?s recent decision to sign off on a billion-dollar arms deal with the kingdom.Videos and photos posted on social media in recent days allegedly show Riyadh using Canadian equipment in a violent crackdown on minority Shia dissidents in eastern Saudi Arabia. Last week at least five people were killed as security forces flushed out suspected militants in the town of Awamiya. Several sources told the Canadian newspaper the Globe and Mail that the vehicles being used appeared to be Gurkha RPVs made in Ontario by Terradyne Armoured Vehicles. Canadian officials said they were deeply concerned by the reports. ?We are looking at these claims very seriously ? and have immediately launched a review,? Justin Trudeau told reporters. In 2016, Saudi Arabia ranked among the largest importers of Canada-made military goods, purchasing more than C$142m worth of goods ? nearly 20% of all Canadian military exports that year.The ministry of global affairs said it was concerned over the escalating violence in eastern Saudi Arabia. In a statement issued last week, it highlighted the causalities among civilians and security forces and urged Riyadh to confront its security challenges in ?a manner that abides by international human rights law?.Days later, the ministry said the government was actively seeking more information about the reports of civilian casualties and claims that Canadian-made vehicles were involved. ?If it is found that Canadian exports have been used to commit serious violations of human rights, the minister will take action,? a spokesperson for department told the Guardian. He did not answer questions around what kinds of actions this could entail. Terradyne Armoured Vehicles did not respond to a request for comment. The allegations have prompted renewed calls for Trudeau?s Liberal government to scrap a recent decision to push forward with a 15-year contract to supply Saudi Arabia with weaponised armoured vehicles made by General Dynamics, another Ontario-based company. Critics say the C$15bn deal, struck in 2014 by the previous conservative government, could see the vehicles ? which are equipped with machine guns ? used by the Saudis to crush dissent at home. Others have pointed to Canadian rules that restrict arms exports to countries with poor human rights records and prohibit exports if there is a possibility that the buyer could use the arms against its own population. Despite these concerns, Trudeau?s Liberal government signed off on the export permits in 2016. Trudeau has since defended the decision, arguing that Canada would be seen as a ?banana republic? if it scrapped the deal. ?People have to know that when you sign a deal with Canada, a change in governments won?t immediately scrap the jobs and benefits coming from it,? the prime minister told the Toronto Star last year. The deal would reportedly create around 3,000 jobs in Canada. Amid escalating concerns over human rights, countries such as Germany and Belgium have in recent years denied export applications for arms headed to Saudi Arabia. In 2015, Sweden cancelled a longstanding defence agreement with the Saudis, citing similar concerns. This month, a high court in London ruled that the UK could proceed with arms sales to Saudi Arabia. ?Saudi Arabia has been, and remains, genuinely committed to compliance with International Humanitarian Law; and there was no ?real risk? that there might be ?serious violations? of International Humanitarian Law (in its various manifestations) such that UK arm sales to Saudi Arabia should be suspended or cancelled,? the court said. Campaigners called the ruling a ?green light? for the UK to sell arms to ?brutal dictatorships and human rights abusers?.In Canada, Amnesty International pointed to the indications that Canadian vehicles are being used against civilians to call on the Liberal government to reverse its support of the billion-dollar arms deal.?Mounting tensions and conflict in eastern Saudi Arabia, about which the Canadian government has rightly expressed public concern, further indicate how fraught it is for Canada to have authorised the sale of light armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia at this time,? secretary-general Alex Neve said in a statement.

Khan told a gathering of thousands of supporters on Sunday.The rally in Islamabad was a triumphant celebration for the heartthrob-cricketer-turned-populist-politician, who, since last year, has led a campaign to oust Sharif.Friday?s ruling by Pakistan?s highest court disrupted what had otherwise looked like a smooth path to next year?s election for Sharif?s PML-N party.Former oil minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi will most likely be approved as interim prime minister on Tuesday, at a special session in the 342-member parliament, where the ruling PML-N party holds a strong majority.Abbasi will hold the position for less than two months, until Shahbaz Sharif, younger brother of the ousted prime minister, is confirmed in parliament and can take over.Thousands of supporters from Khan?s Pakistan Tehreek-e Insaf (PTI) party congregated at Islamabad?s parade ground on Sunday for what had been termed a ?thanksgiving day?, the latest of Khan?s signature rallies that have helped him drum up popular support.In front of flag-flying party cadres dressed in the red and green colours of PTI, among towers of loudspeakers blasting music, Khan likened Pakistan?s rulers to ?mafia who safeguard personal interests at any cost?.?When we decided to move against Nawaz in the Panama case, everyone said it was a mistake because in the past, the powerful and mighty ones have been protected. But today I salute the court for giving hope to people for a new Pakistan,? he said.Since his political ascension in 2011, after 15 years in politics, Khan has drawn support particularly from educated urbanites disillusioned with their political elites.?Imran Khan is fighting hard to let people know their political rights and their role in society. He has been a true example,? said Syed Ishfaq, face painted red and green, who had travelled to the capital from Peshawar to participate in the celebration. Last year, Khan received a timely boost with the leak of the so-called Panama Papers, giving credence to his attacks against the political establishment, whom he has called ?the coalition of the corrupt?.After the leak, Khan filed a constitutional petition to have the supreme court investigate the purchase of high-end London property through offshore companies in the name of Sharif?s children, then minors.He organised street protests and demanded a ?lockdown? of Islamabad until the country?s highest court ordered an inquiry into the PM.Sharif, though, was not dismissed for actual corruption but for being deemed dishonest, according to the constitution?s article 62, over unreported income of about £2,000 from a Dubai-based company owned by his son. Sharif claims he never received the salary.However, he has not completely dodged a corruption verdict. In its ruling, the supreme court ordered a criminal investigation by an accountability court into the Sharif family based on materials from the Panama Papers.The ouster of Sharif has highlighted the decades-long fractious relationship between the now ex-prime minister and the military.

In its ruling, the supreme court ordered a criminal investigation by an accountability court into the Sharif family based on materials from the Panama Papers.The ouster of Sharif has highlighted the decades-long fractious relationship between the now ex-prime minister and the military. ?When we decided to move against Nawaz in the Panama case, everyone said it was a mistake because in the past, the powerful and mighty ones have been protected. of Islamabad until the country?s highest court ordered an inquiry into the PM.Sharif, though, was not dismissed for actual corruption but for being deemed dishonest, according to the constitution?s article 62, over unreported income of about £2,000 from a Dubai-based company owned by his son. he said.Since his political ascension in 2011, after 15 years in politics, Khan has drawn support particularly from educated urbanites disillusioned with their political elites.","Opposition leader Imran Khan has called for a future of?real democracy? in the country. The rally in Islamabad was a triumphant celebration for the heartthrob-cricketer-turned-populist-politician. Shahid Khaqan Abbasi will most likely be approved as interim prime minister on Tuesday, at a special session in parliament. Friday?s court decision sparked hope among demonstrators that the country?s corrupt leaders can be held accountable. The appointment of Nawaz?s younger brother as new prime minister does little to accommodate equally forceful complaints that the Sharif family holds a dynastic grip on power.Supporters of Sharif point out that during his tenure, the economy has grown and security has improved markedly.

But Puerto Rican singers Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee on Monday said they do not approve at all.?At no point was I asked, nor did I authorize, the use or the change in lyrics of Despacito for political ambitions, and much less in the middle of a deplorable situation that Venezuela, a country I love so much, is living,? Fonsi said in a message posted on Twitter. Daddy Yankee, meanwhile, posted a picture of Maduro with a big red cross over it on Instagram. ?That you illegally appropriate a song (Despacito) does not compare with the crimes you commit and have committed in Venezuela. Your dictatorial regime is a joke, not only for my Venezuelan brothers, but for the entire world,? he said. ?With this nefarious marketing plan, you only highlight your fascist ideal.? Millions of Venezuelans have been staging months of protests against Maduro, a former bus driver and union leader narrowly elected to replace the late Hugo Chavez in 2013. Some 100 people have died in the unrest, which has further hammered an imploding economy that is running short of food and medicine.

The temporary swimming zones at the canal were the culmination of a 10-year effort by officials to purify the canal water. Swimming in Paris' city waters was banned in 1923 over fears of currents and water quality. ","A new public swimming area on Paris?s Canal de l?Ourcq has reopened after it was temporarily closed due to higher than normal bacteria levels following weekend rains.The floating structure that has been put in place for the summer has allowed Parisians to legally swim in the canal at La Villette for the first time in decades. It proved very popular when it opened this month and was hailed by the Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, as the beginning of a ?dream? to launch open swimming areas in other city waterways, including on the river Seine in 2024 if Paris succeeds in its bid to host the Olympics that year.The swimming area was briefly closed on Monday after a routine test on Sunday night found higher than normal levels of enterococci, bacteria found in faecal matter. The city of Paris tweeted that the pool was closed because the water quality was ?unsatisfactory?.The pool reopened on Tuesday morning after subsequent tests found the water quality was back to normal. It is thought that heavy rainfall at the weekend had led to the higher than normal readings of bacteria levels.Tests are regularly made at a point upstream from the swimming area to ensure the water quality is within guidelines.

The move is aimed at ending the crisis which claimed seven lives, Israeli officials said. The Palestinians reportedly see the installation of metal detectors as an Israeli attempt to assert control over the holy site.","Israel is removing metal detectors from entrances to the compound that houses al-Aqsa mosque.The move was announced late on Monday night by the office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and is designed to end a crisis over the holy site. Days of violent confrontations have claimed seven lives.Despite the Israeli announcement, however, a senior Muslim cleric in Jerusalem said worshippers should stay away from the shrine pending a review of the new Israeli security arrangements there.Ikrema Sabri, the head of the Supreme Islamic Committee in the city, said such a review may be completed later on Tuesday. Sabri said: ?Our position is that for now, nobody should enter? the shrine.The removal of the detectors on Tuesday appeared to be part of a deal under which Israeli diplomats were repatriated from Jordan, including an embassy security guard who was involved in a fatal shooting of two Jordanians on Sunday night.The brief statement said the Israeli security cabinet, which met on Monday evening, had ?accepted the recommendation of all of the security bodies to incorporate security measures based on advanced technologies (?smart checks?) and other measures instead of metal detectors in order to ensure the security of visitors and worshippers in the Old City and on the Temple Mount?.The statement added that under the plan Israeli police would ?reinforce? their presence around the holy site. It did not say when the metal detectors would be removed or what would replace them.

17,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/25/china-future-president-ousted-xi-jinping-iron-discipline-sun-zhengcai?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle,"Top Communist Party of China politician Sun Zhengcai, who was considered a potential successor to President Xi Jinping, is reportedly being investigated for corruption by his party. The probe against Zhengcai, who was recently ejected from his role as Party's Secretary for Chongqing city, eliminates him from the contest to become China's next President.","He studied agriculture in rural England and was tipped by some as China?s future leader.But on Tuesday morning Sun Zhengcai?s political obituary was splashed across the front page of the Communist party?s official mouthpiece in a damning editorial entitled: ?Rule strictly over the party with iron discipline.??The investigation into comrade Sun Zhengcai sounds the alarm bell for the party,? the People?s Daily article warned, as it announced that the youngest member of China?s political elite had been ejected from power for a ?serious violation of discipline?.?Top cadres must hold firm political positions, temper their political characters ? and act in a manner consistent with the party?s central committee with [president] Xi Jinping as its core,? the broadsheet declared. Just a few weeks ago, Sun, a 53-year-old former agriculture minister who studied farming at Hertfordshire?s Rothamstad research centre in the 1990s, was the high-flying party chief of one of the world?s fastest-growing cities, the sweltering Yangtze port of Chongqing.Many believed he was being groomed for greatness and would use that job ? handed to him in late 2012 after the sensational downfall of flamboyant party leader Bo Xilai ? as a springboard from which to leap into one of seven highly-coveted spots on China?s top ruling body, the politburo standing committee. Places on that elite council will be up for grabs later this year when Chinese leaders flock to Beijing for their quinquennial enclave, the 19th Communist party congress.Such a promotion would likely have put Sun ? part of the so-called sixth generation of post-revolution leaders ? in line to succeed either Xi or premier Li Keqiang at the next party congress in 2022.But Xi?s unforeseen decision to purge Sun has shredded not only those expectations but also the playbook governing how one-party China conducts political leadership successions. In doing so, some experts fear Xi may also have set in motion a new phase of political turbulence in the world?s number two economy.?A smooth leadership transition is really crucial to the survival of Chinese Communist party rule in China and this really throws a monkey wrench into the machine,? said Susan Shirk, a US expert in elite Chinese politics who was deputy assistant secretary of state under Bill Clinton.Shirk said that for almost two decades China?s rulers had abided by an unofficial succession system designed to prevent both cut-throat and destabilising internecine power struggles and the rise of strongman dictators who could cling to power until they died or were violently overthrown.According to those unwritten rules, presumptive heirs to the Communist party?s top two jobs, general secretary and premier, should be informally anointed five years ahead of a full leadership transition, as had happened with Xi and Li in 2007. Some had seen Sun as one of those two likely heirs ? the other was Guangdong party chief Hu Chunhua, who remains in power ? and the decision to bring him down now brought ?intense uncertainty about how the game will be played in the future?, Shirk said. ?I think that has got to make the people at the top ranks of the Chinese communist party very uneasy about the risks that presents.?As with much about Chinese politics, the exact nature of Sun?s alleged crimes remains murky, as does the political rationale behind his defenestration.The first hint of his undoing came when one of Xi?s feared corruption-busting teams descended on Chongqing late last year. In its subsequent report the group accused his administration of failing to eliminate the poisonous and pernicious ?ideological legacy? of Bo Xilai, a bitter Xi rival, who had been ousted five years earlier after the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood sparked China?s biggest political scandal in decades. Then, in mid-July, came the unexpected and unexplained announcement that Sun had been replaced by a Xi loyalist who vowed to purify the city?s ?political ecosystem?. Sun is rumoured to have been taken into custody while attending a conference in Beijing.Cheng Li, the director of the Brookings Institute?s China Center, said it was unclear if Sun was facing accusations of corruption or political offences such as conspiring against Xi: ?It could be either ? or both.?Many believe Xi, who some suspect hopes to stay in power beyond 2022, viewed Sun as a power-hungry competitor who had to be eliminated. Li, an authority on the Communist party?s elite, said that even before the purge: ?I have talked to many people who know Sun [and they said] ? ?That guy has a very strong personal ambition; you simply cannot believe what he says and what he promises?.?In Chinese, you use the term ?yóu?

Water supply shutdowns could last as long as eight hours daily as some parts of the country received rainfall totalling 80% below normal, officials said. The drought could reportedly lead to Rome's famed fountains being turned off. ","Scarce rain and chronically leaky aqueducts have combined to put Romans at risk of drastic water rationing as soon as this week.Sky TG24 TV meteorologists noted on Sunday that Italy had experienced one of its driest springs in some 60 years and that some parts of the country had seen rainfall totals 80% below normal. Among the hardest-hit regions was Sardinia, which is seeking natural disaster status.Farmers? lobby Coldiretti last week estimated ?2bn ($2.3bn) worth of damage had been done to Italian agriculture so far.

Among those suffering are farmers growing canning tomatoes in the southeastern region of Puglia, wine grapes throughout much of Italy and those cultivating olives ? all signature crops for the nation.Another afflicted area was the province in Parma, an area in north-central Italy renowned for Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and prized prosciutto.Rome?s water supply worries have turned political. Last week, the governor of Lazio region, which includes the Italian capital, ordered that no more water be drawn from Lake Bracciano, which supplies some of the Italian capital, because the drastically decreasing water level posed danger to the aquatic life of the lake.The lake, 40km from Rome, used to be used only for backup water supply but recent years have seen it being tapped on a regular basis.Rome water company ACEA warned that without the lake, drastic rationing loomed. Italian media said staggered water supply shutdowns could last as long as eight hours daily in alternating neighbourhoods and start as soon as Wednesday. Rome?s famed fountains risk being turned off.The move put populist 5-Star Movement Mayor Virginia Raggi under pressure, since the city of Rome is a major shareholder in Acea.
